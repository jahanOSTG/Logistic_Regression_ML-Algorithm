###  Logistic Regression

**Logistic Regression** is a popular **classification algorithm** used in Machine Learning to predict **categorical outcomes** — like **yes or no**, **pass or fail**, **spam or not spam**.

Although it's called *regression*, it’s actually used for **binary classification** (`0` or `1`) by converting a **linear equation into a probability** using the **sigmoid function**.
